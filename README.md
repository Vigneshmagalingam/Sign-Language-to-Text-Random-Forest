# Sign Language to Text Recognition

This project aims to recognize sign language gestures captured through a webcam and translate them into text using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to interpret hand gestures captured through a webcam and convert them into textual representations. The system detects hand landmarks using the MediaPipe Hands library and classifies the gestures using a Random Forest Classifier model trained on hand gesture data.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition
- Translation of sign language gestures to text
- User-friendly interface
- Integration with OpenCV and MediaPipe for computer vision tasks

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Vigneshmagalingam/sign-language-to-text.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd sign-language-to-text
```

3. Run the application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Use your webcam to capture sign language gestures, and the application will display the recognized text in real-time.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the machine learning model consists of hand gesture images collected from various sources. Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can train your own model using the provided code and your dataset.
